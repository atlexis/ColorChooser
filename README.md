# ColorChooser

ColorChooser is a simple application to select a color with sliders.
You can see a preview of the color, and also the hexcode for the color.
The application has three modes:
- Normal mode - Has three sliders for selecting RGB color
- Alpha mode - Has four sliders for selecting RGBA color
- CSS mode - Has four sliders with Alpha slider in increments of 0.1 between 0 and 1.
	- This mode does not display the correct colors, so do not use

Only tested on macOS, and will probably not work on any other OS.
